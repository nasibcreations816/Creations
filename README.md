2. **Haunted Mirror**- The second Project uploaded is the haunted mirror. This project is created to upload a video and sound to create something that had to deal with a mirror. I uploaded a scream from which I downloaded and an image croped into a mirror shape. [Haunted Mirror](https://github.com/nasibcreations816/Creations/blob/master/Haunted%20Mirror)
3. **Pacman**- The third project uploaded is pacman. The concept of this project was to create moving shapes but adhering to the theme of retro games. He doesn't move but it's a start to what I would like to complete. [Pacman](https://github.com/nasibcreations816/Creations/blob/master/Pacman.)
4. **Space**- The fourth project uploaded is one of the first lines of code I had to do. The idea for this project was to get familar creating different shapes and colors. [Space](https://github.com/nasibcreations816/Creations/blob/master/Space)
5. **TV**- The last project uploaded is the moving dynamics of the old school DVD pause screen. This project was to get the students familiar with moving shapes and adding mouseclick changes as well. [TV](https://github.com/nasibcreations816/Creations/blob/master/TV)
